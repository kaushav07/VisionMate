# VisionMate

**VisionMate** is an assistive technology project designed to empower visually impaired individuals by providing smart, real-time guidance for safer and more independent navigation.

## Project Overview

VisionMate uses computer vision, text recognition, and speech tech to help users:  

- Recognize objects and surroundings  
- Read printed or handwritten text out loud  
- Control the system easily with voice commands  
- Get real-time alerts about obstacles  
- Add new features easily in the future  

This is the early development and ideation phase. The repository will include prototypes, research notes, and starter code as the project progresses.

## Features (Planned)

- âœ… Real-time object detection  
- âœ… Text-to-speech to read out text
- âœ… Speech-based user controls  
- âœ… Environment awareness for obstacle detection  
- âœ… Modular architecture for future feature integration

## Technology Stack

| Part                | Technology / Tools                        |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Programming Language| Python                                    |
| Computer Vision     | OpenCV, Google Cloud Vision API (planned) |
| Backend Framework   | Flask / Django (to be decided)            |
| Frontend / App      | React.js / Flutter (planned)              |
| Database            | MySQL                                     |
| Accessibility APIs  | Text-to-Speech / Speech-to-Text APIs      |

## How It Works 

Hereâ€™s how VisionMate works step-by-step:

1. **Captures Input:**  
   Uses a camera to take live pictures or videos of the surroundings.

2. **Detects Objects:**  
   Uses computer vision to find and identify things like doors, obstacles, signs, etc.

3. **Reads Text:**  
   Uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to detect printed or handwritten text.

4. **Speech Processing:**  
   - Converts detected text to speech so the user can hear it.  
   - Listens to userâ€™s voice commands to control the system.

5. **Gives Feedback:**  
   Provides real-time audio alerts about obstacles and text info to help the user move safely.

6. **Modular Design:**  
   Built so new features and better AI can be added later easily.
