# VisionMate

**VisionMate** is an assistive technology project designed to empower visually impaired individuals by providing smart, real-time guidance for safer and more independent navigation.

## Project Overview

VisionMate aims to integrate advanced computer vision, text recognition, and speech technologies to help users:
- Identify objects and surroundings
- Read printed or handwritten text aloud
- Provide real-time feedback through a simple, user-friendly interface

This is the early development and ideation phase. The repository will include prototypes, research notes, and starter code as the project progresses.

## Features (Planned)

âœ… Object detection using computer vision  
âœ… Text-to-speech functionality  
âœ… Speech-based user controls  
âœ… Environment awareness for obstacle detection  
âœ… Modular architecture for future feature integration  

## Tech Stack

- **Python** â€“ Core backend and computer vision  
- **OpenCV** â€“ Image processing and recognition  
- **Flask / Django** â€“ Backend framework (to be finalized)  
- **React.js / Flutter** â€“ Frontend or app interface  
- **MySQL** â€“ Data storage  
- **Google Cloud Vision API** â€“ (future integration)  
- **Text-to-Speech / Speech-to-Text APIs** â€“ Accessibility tools

## Voice & Keyboard Controls

Press s on the keyboard or say "scan" through your microphone to trigger scene analysis.

## Getting Started

> ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**: Only starter files and prototypes are included at this stage.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following before running the project:

- **Python 3.10+**
- **pip** for installing Python packages
- **Stable Wi-Fi connection** (required for speech recognition and Gemini AI API)
- **Webcam access** (built-in or external webcam)
- **Microphone access** (for voice commands)

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaushav07/VisionMate.git
cd VisionMate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
