👁️ VisionMate
VisionMate is an assistive technology solution designed to empower visually impaired individuals by offering real-time, smart guidance for safer and more independent navigation.

🧠 Project Overview
VisionMate leverages a combination of computer vision, text recognition, and speech processing to help users:

🔍 Identify objects and surroundings
📖 Read printed or handwritten text aloud
🎙️ Interact using voice commands
🦯 Receive real-time audio feedback on obstacles
💡 Access a user-friendly interface designed for accessibility
⚠️ This project is currently in its early development and ideation phase. The repository will grow to include:

Prototypes
Research notes
Starter code
API integration plans
✨ Planned Features
✅ Object detection using computer vision (OpenCV / Google Vision API)
✅ Text-to-speech for printed and handwritten content
✅ Speech-based user controls
✅ Real-time environment awareness (obstacle detection)
✅ Modular and scalable architecture for future feature integration
